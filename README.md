# Dream Shoppe

Final project for CS50 @edX

I learned through quite a bit of tutorials and lots of resources online for this project.
It is my first try of building a simple little game simulating a shopping cart app by Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and deployed on Vercel.
Utilized a spreadsheet API instead of a full scale database due to the very simple needs.

Users can generate some random shopping points to purchase the intengible goods (in real world they are priceless).
The shoppe items are listed by ranking from the highest and most popular demand.
Try to spend all you have and see if you got them all until zero point is left!
I hope it encourages the pursuit of your dreams.
