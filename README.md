# Dream Shoppe

Final project for CS50 @edX

I learned through quite a bit of tutorials and lots of resources online for this project.
It is my first try of building a simple little game simulating a shopping cart app by Next.js and deployed on Vercel.
Utilized a spreadsheet API instead of a full scale database due to the very simple needs.

Users can generate some random shoppoing points to purchase the intengible goods (in real world they are priceless).
The shoppe items are listed by ranking from the highest and most popular demand.
Try to spend all you have and see if you get it all until zero point left!
I hope it encourages the pursuit of your dreams.
